# Atmosfera

This is the iOS version of Atmosfera App developed with Swift. The app uses a remote API (http://46.101.143.44/) to display the latest measurements of the Air Quality in your location. At this moment the app uses only one monitoring station in Prishtina. We plan to integrate other stations very soon. 

The application lets you select some diseasses and get notifications if any of the factors that affect this diseasse is above the allowed rate. 

You can integrate the application with your wearable of choice and get notifications on your watch. We plan to integrate this app with other apps such as Google Calendar, to get location based notifications. 

P.S. Atmosfera means Atmosphere in Albanian.
